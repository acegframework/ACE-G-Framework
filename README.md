# ACE+G Framework for AI Adoption Maturity

## Unlocking AI's True Potential: A Common Language for the Enterprise

Many companies today are grappling with how to effectively measure AI adoption and the value it delivers. This often leads to a **"lack of a common method"** and an **"industry gap"** where no clear, shared answer exists for assessing AI's true effectiveness and contribution.

The **ACE+G Framework** aims to bridge this gap by providing a **"common yardstick for AI maturity"** across the industry. It empowers leaders to shift their focus from merely tracking activities to understanding tangible outcomes: **"What enterprise value have we unlocked, and how safely?"**.

## Why This Framework Matters to You

The ACE+G Framework offers distinct benefits for various stakeholders:

*   **For Boards and Investors:** Gain confidence that AI initiatives are actively **"unlocking trapped productivity"**, **"creating new value streams"**, and **"protecting enterprise value"**.
*   **For C-Level Executives (CEOs, CIOs, CFOs):** Develop a clear understanding of current AI maturity, identify specific areas for improvement, and build a strategic roadmap for progression.
*   **For All Practitioners:** Establishes a shared language and a structured approach for discussing, implementing, and measuring AI initiatives effectively.

## Our Core Principles: Open, Collaborative, Outcome-Focused, Value-Driven

The ACE+G Framework is designed to be **open, collaborative, outcome-focused, and value-driven**. Our intention is to **"build this in the open"** with input from a diverse group of stakeholders, including boards, investors, CEOs, CIOs, CFOs, competitors, design partners, and customers. This collaborative approach is key to establishing ACE+G as a universal standard for AI maturity.

## Understanding the Core Components: ACE+G

The framework is built upon four distinct, yet interconnected, pillars:

*   **A - Augmentation:** Focuses on enhancing human capabilities through AI to achieve **"smarter work"**: improving existing processes, leading to "better emails, faster research, and sharper insights".
    *   *Value:* Primarily related to improving individual/team productivity and operational efficiency.
*   **C - Creation:** Involves generating **"net new value"** through AI, such as "apps, products, and business models".
    *   *Value:* Primarily related to market differentiation, revenue growth, and new product/service development.
*   **E - Execution:** Centres on embedding **"agentic systems in workflows"**, enabling "autonomous actions with human oversight to deliver outcomes at scale".
    *   *Value:* Primarily related to scalability, significant cost reduction through automation, and transformational operational capabilities.
*   **+G - Governance:** Establishes **"guardrails"** including "policy, compliance, and accountability" for the safe and responsible adoption of AI.
    *   *Value:* Primarily related to mitigating risks (ethical, reputational, regulatory, operational), building trust, and ensuring continuous compliance.
