# Contributing to the ACE+G Framework

The ACE+G Framework for AI Adoption Maturity is a collaborative, open-source initiative designed to provide a **"common yardstick for AI maturity"** across the industry [5]. Our core principles are **open, collaborative, outcome-focused, and value-driven** [2]. We are building this framework in the open with input from diverse stakeholders, and we welcome your contributions to help refine and expand it [2, 3].

By contributing to the ACE+G Framework, you help empower leaders to shift their focus from merely tracking activities to understanding tangible outcomes: **"What enterprise value have we unlocked, and how safely?"** [6].
