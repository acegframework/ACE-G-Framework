# Assessment Example

This example demonstrates how to apply the ACE+G maturity rubric to evaluate an AI adoption initiative. Suppose an organization is implementing a machine learning model for predictive maintenance.

## Context
Briefly describe the AI initiative. Identify the business problem, the stakeholders, and the goals of the project.

## Rubric Application
- **Adoption:** Evaluate which maturity level best describes your current adoption practices.
- **Compliance:** Assess the extent to which the initiative follows regulations and ethical guidelines.
- **Engagement:** Consider how effectively stakeholders are engaged throughout the project lifecycle.
- **Governance:** Examine decision-making structures, accountability, and oversight mechanisms.

## Outcome
Summarize the findings and identify next steps for moving to the next maturity level.
